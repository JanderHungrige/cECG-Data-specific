---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Results for the INSTANTANEOUS heart rate (peak to peak basis, with channel selection strategy #1).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Time coverage:
	total = 14.9583 min; good% = 98 % (98 %)

Interpretation:
For 14.9583 minutes of data, the RR-intervals where perfectly detected during 14.5961 minutes (i.e. 98% of the time).
If we exclude the interventions and ignored periods, we are left with 14.9583 minutes of data from which 14.5961 minutes lead to a perfect detection of RR-intervals.
In other words, when the baby doesn't receive special care, the instantaneous heart rate is perfectly reliable during 98% of the time.
(Note that his percentage of time is changed to 98% if we use only 2 sensors from the array of 8 sensors.)

Lost segments:
	# = 0 ; max = 0.768 s

Interpretation:
If we exclude the interventions and ignored periods, there were 0 segments of data LONGER than 10 seconds which didn't allowed an accurate instantaneous heart rate computation.
The longest period of unreliable instantaneous heart rate for this dataset (intervention and ignored periods excluded) was of 0.768 seconds.

Details of the peak detection for different motion levels:
	Activity	Minutes	PPV	SEN	ERROR
	----------------------------------
	No motion	15.0	99.7	98.5	0.02
	Low motion	0.0	NaN	NaN	NaN
	High motion	0.0	NaN	NaN	NaN
	Intervent.	0.0	NaN	NaN	NaN
	----------------------------------
	Whole data	15.0	99.7	98.5	0.02
	----------------------------------
	No intervent.	15.0	99.7	98.5	0.02

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Results for the AVERAGED heart rate (mean iHR value over the last 10 seconds (at least)).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Time coverage:
	total = 14.9833 min; good% = 81 %, bad% = 19
	Rel. Indic. ----> good% = 90 %, bad% = 8

Interpretation:
By comparing the averaged HR signal with the reference averaged HR signal, an error may occur.
If we assume that an error of 3 bpm is acceptable, then we have an reliable heart rate on the whole dataset for 81% of the 14.9833 minutes considered.
(Note that if a reliability indicator is used during the computation of the mean, then we get a reliable heart rate on the whole dataset for 90% of the 14.9833 minutes considered.)
If we assume that an error of 3 bpm is acceptable and if we exclude the intervention periods, then we have an reliable heart rate for 81% of the 14.9833 minutes considered.
(Note that if a reliability indicator is used during the computation of the mean, then we get a reliable heart rate (intervention excluded) for 90% of the 14.9833 minutes considered.)

Lost segments:
	# = 8; max = 17 s
	Rel. Indic. --> # = 1; max = 11 s

Interpretation:
If we exclude the interventions and ignored periods, there were 8 segments of data LONGER than 10 seconds during which the averaged heart rate was not matching the reference averaged heart rate.
The longest period of unreliable averaged heart rate for this dataset (intervention and ignored periods excluded) was of 17 seconds.
(Note that if a reliability indicator is used during the computation of the mean, we got 1 segments of data LONGER than 10 seconds whose max is of 11 seconds.)

	No motion   		14.98		90		 8
	Low motion  		0.00		NaN		NaN
	High motion 		0.00		NaN		NaN
